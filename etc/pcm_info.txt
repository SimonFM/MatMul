You may be aware that modern processors provide hardware performance counters
that allow you to count "events" that happen while your program is
running. Events include things like an instruction executing, a branch
misprediction or a cache miss. Modern processors provide a performance
monitoring unit (PMU) that can be programmed to count different events.

The sysadmins have very kindly set up the Intel Performance Counter Monitor
(PCM) software on stoker. On most machines you need to be root to access the PMU
at all, but the sysadmins have set up stoker so anyone can program the PMU using
PCM. PCM provides a simple interface to the PMU, which saves you from having to
program the PMU. To get (a lot of) data on your running program, type:

    pcm.x <program-name>

For example:

    pcm.x  ls

There is a complication: there is only one PMU on each CPU. As I understand it,
Intel's PCM takes control of the PMU on all CPUs. So only one user can use the
PMUs at any time. So if you are using PCM, please don't use it for very
long-running programs.
