The following is a list of the original authors of the MatMul matrix
multiplication program, created in 2015 as part of the coursework for a
university module on concurrent systems.

    Basil L. Contovounesios             <contovob@tcd.ie>
    Ben Lynch                           <belynch@tcd.ie>
    Simon Markham                       <markhams@tcd.ie>

The test harness (src/harness.c) was written by the lecturer of the module and
is, as such, owned by the university, Trinity College Dublin. It was slightly
modified by the authors listed above and is included purely for the purpose of
showing the MatMul program in action, as was inteded for the module.
